Lesson 1 Review
Expo is a service that makes just about everything involving React Native a whole lot easier. The idea behind Expo is that there's no need to use Android Studio or Xcode. What's more: it even allows us to develop for iOS with Windows (or even Linux)!

With Expo, you can load and run projects built by Create React Native App with the same JavaScript you already know. There's no need to compile any native code. And much like Create React App, using Expo with Create React Native App lets us get an application up and running with almost no configuration.
