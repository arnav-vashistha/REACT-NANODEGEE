Summary
What's great about React Native development is that it takes much of what you're used to from web development and takes it to native development. Accessing the in-app developer menu allows you to reload your JavaScript code, debug remotely via Developer Tools, and even display an in-app inspector.

To Debug
All you have to do is shake your phone, or press:

ctrl D in the iOS simulator
ctrl M in the Android simulator
To Refresh
To refresh the app, just:

Double-tap “R” on your keyboard (if using the simulator)
Shake the phone, then select “Refresh”
