Lesson 1 Review
react-redux
react-redux gives us an API that simplifies the most common interactions between React and Redux.

Provider makes it possible for Redux to pass data from the store to any React components that needs it. It uses React’s context feature to make this work.

connect() connects a React component to the Redux store.

Signature of the connect() function: connect([mapStateToProps], [mapDispatchToProps], [mergeProps], [options]).

The mapStateToProps() function allows us to specify which state from the store you want passed to your React component.

The mapDispatchToProps() function allows us to bind dispatch to action creators before they ever hit the component.
