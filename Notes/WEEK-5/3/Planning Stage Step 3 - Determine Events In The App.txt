Determine What Events Happen in the App
-----------------------------------------

We need to take a look at what is happening in each component. Let's determine what actions the app or the user is performing on the data. Is the data being set, modified, or deleted?...then we'll need an action to keep track of that event!

Let's italicize the action and bold the data.

For the Tweets List component, the only information that we see is that we'll have to get a list of all of the tweets. So for this component, we just need to:

get the tweets
So the action type for event this will probably be something like GET_LIST_OF_TWEETS or GET_DATA.
