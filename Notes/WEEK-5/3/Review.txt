Review
The main problems that Redux (and the react-redux bindings!) was meant to solve were:

Propagation of props through the entire component tree.
Ensuring consistency and predictability of the state across the app.
According to Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux, we should follow the following principle for determining whether to store a piece of data in the store or in a React component:

"Use Redux for state that matters globally or is mutated in complex ways… The rule of thumb is: do whatever is less awkward."

Presentational Component
A component that's just responsible for rendering content. Presentational Components are concerned with how things look.

Connected Component/ Container Component
A component that is responsible for interacting with the store. Container Components are concerned with how things work.

Having both Container Components and Presentational Components in your app help you achieve Separation of Concerns.

Our store contains a tweets property, a users property, and an authedUser property.
