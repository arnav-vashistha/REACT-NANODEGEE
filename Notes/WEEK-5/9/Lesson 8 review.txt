A Thunk Action Creator returns a function that will be passed store.dispatch and store.getState when it's invoked.

Reducers are pure functions. According to the Redux documentation, reducers should never:

Mutate its arguments
Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions
Call non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now() or Math.random()
Other things to note about reducers:

Reducers should return the previous state in the default case.
Each reducer should manage an individual slice of data.
The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.
Middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. Thunks are executed in the order they are provided in the applyMiddleware function.
