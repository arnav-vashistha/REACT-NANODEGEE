Quick React Router Review
BrowserRouter Component
BrowserRouter listens for changes in the URL and makes sure that the correct screen shows up when the URL changes.

Doing this:

<BrowserRouter>
   <App />
</BrowserRouter>
will allow us to

use the other components browser-router-dom comes with inside of our app
listen to the URL so that whenever the url changes, the routing components will be notified of the change
Link Component
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
Users navigate through React apps with the help of the Link Component.

The Link component talks to the BrowserRouter and tells it to update the URL. By passing a to property to the Link component, you tell your app which path to route to.

What if you wanted to pass state to the new route? Instead of passing a string to Links to prop, you can pass it an object like this:

<Link to={{
 pathname: '/courses',
 search: '?sort=name',
 hash: '#the-hash',
 state: { fromDashboard: true }
}}>
 Courses
</Link>
NavLink
A special version of the that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.

Route
Its most basic responsibility is to render some UI when a location matches the route’s path.
