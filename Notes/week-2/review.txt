Lesson 10 Summary
Review
Route Component
Route takes a path property. If the path matches the URL, then the Route will render some UI.

Example:

<Route path='/create' component={CreateContact} />
If you want to be able to pass props to a specific component that the router is going to render, you'll need to use Route’s render prop.

Example:

<Route exact path='/' render={() => (
   <ListContacts contacts={this.state.contacts} onDeleteContact={this.removeContact} />
)} />
Forms
Instead of having the browser handle forms in a default way, we can control the flow ourselves.

Example:

handleSubmit = (e) => {
   e.preventDefault()
   const values = serializeForm(e.target, { hash: true })

    if (this.props.onCreateContact) {
       this.props.onCreateContact(values)
    }
}
We can serialize the form and save it into an object ourselves with the help of the form-serialize package. We can then pass that object up to the parent component.
