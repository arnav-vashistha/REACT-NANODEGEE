More Asynchronous Options
------------------------------
The most common requests I get for this course are around more advanced data-fetching topics with Redux. I've resisted because typically they bring in a lot of complexity, while the benefits aren't seen until your data-fetching needs become large enough. With that said, now that you have a solid foundation on Redux and specifically, asynchronous Redux, you'll be in a good position to read up on the different options to decide if any would work best for the type of application you're working on. I encourage to read up on both of the other (popular) options.

Redux Promise - FSA-compliant promise middleware for Redux.
Redux Saga - An alternative side effect model for Redux apps

Goals code to use thunks
Todos code to use
initial data fetching to use thunks
