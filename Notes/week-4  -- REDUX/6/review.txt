In this section, we looked at using middleware. According to the Redux docs:

Middleware is the suggested way to extend Redux with custom functionality.

Middleware is added to the Redux store using Redux.applyMiddleware(). You can only add middleware when you initially create the store:

const store = Redux.createStore( <reducer-function>, Redux.applyMiddleware(<middleware-functions>) )
