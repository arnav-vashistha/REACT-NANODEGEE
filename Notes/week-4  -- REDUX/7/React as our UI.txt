In this lesson, we're going to move away from our application being plain HTML and convert it to being powered by React. To do that, we'll need to add a number of libraries:

react
react-dom
babel
Here are the packages that we'll be adding in the next video:

<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.3.0-alpha.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.3.0-alpha.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.15.0/babel.min.js"></script>
